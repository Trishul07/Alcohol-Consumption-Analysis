# Alcohol-Consumption-Analysis

This Project focuses on exploring and analyzing data related to alcohol consumption and its impact on college students. The project highlights the prevalence of alcohol-related issues among adolescents, such as injuries, assaults, and academic performance decline. To gain insights into these patterns, the researchers utilized the "BRFSS_ok-2" and "Demographics_ok" files. It involves creation of a database and  tables, importing data from the files, merging tables, and establishing relationships between them.

Through various SQL queries, the project tackles different tasks to explore and analyze the data. Tasks include querying the "brfss_ok" table to retrieve information on the survey data, investigating survey responses related to heavy drinking among adolescents, analyzing heavy drinking patterns of 18-24 year-olds, calculating the percentage of abusers by age group, and identifying the highest and lowest number of adolescent abusers by county and city in Oklahoma state.

Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of alcohol consumption patterns among college students using BRFSS data. It demonstrates the application of SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and shed light on the prevalence and impact of alcohol related issues, thereby contributing to the understanding of this critical health concern.
